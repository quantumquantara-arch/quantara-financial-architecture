# Quantara Financial Architecture — Unified Investor Portal (USD)

**Quantara** is a planetary-scale **financial framework** for coherence-intelligent economies.  
It turns value into a living measure of **alignment**, **energy reciprocity**, and **temporal responsibility**.

## Overview

The Quantara stack unites:

- **AEI — Artificial Energy Intelligence:** pricing aligned with energy & reciprocity.  
- **Coherence Capital:** indices quantifying κ (alignment), τ (time responsibility), Σ (drift risk).  
- **Ethical Markets & Governance:** transparent, self-correcting accountability.  
- **Unified Projection (2025–2035):** long-term revenue and value in **USD**.

## AEI — Energy-Aware Economics

κ terms encode reciprocity, circularity, and ethical alignment.  
Positive coherence lowers cost; negative raises it — restoring market integrity.

## Coherence Capital System

**Indices**

- **κ-Index:** alignment & reciprocity composite  
- **τ-Score:** foresight & long-horizon stewardship  
- **Σ-Drift:** systemic brittleness / risk

**Instruments**

- **CCE — Coherence Credit:** earned via positive κ & τ; tradable  
- **CRB — Coherence Rebate:** automatic reward for ethical efficiency  
- **TEB — Temporal Equity Bond:** yield tied to verified long-term responsibility

Accounting integrates operational + coherence ledgers to quantify verified externality reduction and energy reciprocity.

## Ethical Markets & Governance

- **Proof-of-Foresight:** publish long-horizon duties (τ)  
- **Reciprocity Attestations:** independent ecological verification  
- **Alignment Disclosures:** κ/τ transparency  
- **No hidden externalities:** all costs priced or blocked  
- **Right to audit:** verifiable energy & material data  
- **Anti-drift breakers:** pause & re-price on Σ-Drift spikes
